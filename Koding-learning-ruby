# Learn Ruby with Koding!

So, you want to learn the [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) programming language?  Fantastic!

A great way to learn a new programming language is through exercises called koans.  Koans come from [Buddhism](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-zen-koan.htm), but they have been adapted to help you reach *enlightenment* with Ruby.

The koans we are going to start with are found [here](http://rubykoans.com/).

Ready? Let's get started!


We're going to install our Ruby koans from [github](https://github.com/neo/ruby_koans)

**_Note:_** For any of the commands you'll see in this tutorial, you'll first need to be in your
[Koding Terminal](https://koding.com/Develop/Terminal)


## First step: Verify we have Ruby

An easy way to verify Ruby is installed is to simply ask for its version like this:

```
ruby --version
```

It will say the version of Ruby that has been installed for us, like this:

```
ruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [x86_64-linux]
```


## Second step: Verify we have the rake tool

```
rake --version
```

It will say the version of rake that has been installed for us, like this:

```
rake, version 0.9.2.2
```

**_Note:_** Strictly speaking, you don't need rake, but it will be slightly more convenient, and it is good to know about the rake tool for your future endeavors.

## Third step: Install the Ruby koans

You don't need to know anything about [git](http://git-scm.com/) at this point.  All this is doing, is copying the files from a location on github.com to your virtual machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/neo/ruby_koans.git
```

## Fourth step: Generate the koans

Now that we have all the files we need, we can generate the files that actually allow us to work through the koans themselves.

**_Note:_** If you want to start over, you can just change that *gen* to *regen* and run the command again.  This will reset the koans for you.
 
**_Note:_** You'll want to be in the *ruby_koans* directory when you do this.  As you can see, it is a simple *cd* command away.

    cd ruby_koans
    
    rake gen

## Fifth Step: Try one!

Now, we're all set.  Time to try one!

```
cd koans
```

At this point, you should be in the *koans* directory.  Something like this:

```
/home/ctreptow/ruby_koans/koans
```

Now, you can see where to begin your journey via the *rake* command:

```
rake
```

You'll see output like this the first time:

    /usr/bin/ruby1.9.1 path_to_enlightenment.rb
    AboutAsserts#test_assert_truth has damaged your karma.
     
    The Master says:
      You have not yet reached enlightenment.
     
    The answers you seek...
      Failed assertion.
     
    Please meditate on the following code:
      /home/ctreptow/ruby_koans/koans/about_asserts.rb:10:in 'test_assert_truth'
     
    mountains are merely mountains
    your path thus far [X_________________________________________________] 0/280

So, we now know that the first failure is in a file called *about_asserts.rb* on line *10*.

At this point, you can edit the file using vim, like this:

```
vim about_asserts.rb
```

If you're more comfortable, feel free to use the [Ace](https://koding.com/Ace) editor.

No matter which you choose, the task is the same: get this test to pass!

Luckily, this one is easy: change *false* to *true* on line *10*.

Once done, it's time to see how you've done with our good friend: *rake*:

    AboutAsserts#test_assert_truth has expanded your awareness.
    AboutAsserts#test_assert_with_message has damaged your karma.
     
    The Master says:
      You have not yet reached enlightenment.
      You are progressing. Excellent. 1 completed.
     
    The answers you seek...
      This should be true -- Please fix this
     
    Please meditate on the following code:
      /home/ctreptow/ruby_koans/koans/about_asserts.rb:16:in 'test_assert_with_message'
     
    learn the rules so you know how to break them properly
    your path thus far     [.X________________________________________________] 1/280

Now that's what I call progress!  Good job!!


## Sixth Step: Achieve enlightenment

This last step is really about continuing the process.  You will be repeating the steps as you learn.

You may find it nicer to add the *clear* command.  This will clear the old output from the screen for you.

Like this:

    clear && rake
    
    vim <some file>

**_Note:_** Don't like having to run the *rake* command by hand?  That's cool, we have a solution!

First go up one directory:

```
cd ..
```

Then install *watchr*

**_Note:_** You'll need to enter your Koding password when asked.

```
sudo gem install watchr
```

Now, start watching the folder:

```
watchr ./koans/koans.watchr
```

You'll probably find it way more convenient to use [Ace](https://koding.com/Ace) with *watchr* running, because as soon as you save the file, *watchr* will run rake for you and the output could get hard to follow.


**_Note:_** Remember to take breaks, your Koding environment will be there waiting for you.

Now, go forth and get *enlightened*, but most of all...

Have fun!
