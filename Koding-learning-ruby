# Getting started learning Ruby

So, you want to learn the Ruby programming language?  A great way to learn a new programming language is through
exercises called koans.

Koans come from Buddhism (http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-zen-koan.htm), but they have been adapted to help you
reach "enlightenment" with Ruby.

The koans we are going to start with are found here:  http://rubykoans.com/.

Let's get started!

We're going to install our Ruby koans from github.com.  Here's the link:  https://github.com/neo/ruby_koans

## First step: Verify we have Ruby

From your [Koding Terminal](https://koding.com/Develop/Terminal), type the following:

```
ruby --version
```

It will say the version of Ruby that has been installed for us.

## Second step: Verify we the rake tool

From your [Koding Terminal](https://koding.com/Develop/Terminal), type the following:

```
rake --version
```

It will say the version of Ruby that has been installed for us.

## Third step: Install the Ruby koans

From your [Koding Terminal](https://koding.com/Develop/Terminal), type the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/neo/ruby_koans.git
```

## Fourth step: Generate the koans

From your [Koding Terminal](https://koding.com/Develop/Terminal), type the following:

```
cd ruby_koans
rake gen
```

## Fifth Step: Try one!

From your [Koding Terminal](https://koding.com/Develop/Terminal), type the following:

```
cd koans
rake

vim about_asserts.rb (or ACE)
```

## Sixth Step: Achieve enlightenment

This last step is really about continuing the process.  You will be repeating the steps as you learn.

From your [Koding Terminal](https://koding.com/Develop/Terminal), type the following:

```
clear && rake
vim <some file>
```

Don't like having to run rake by hand?  That's cool, we have a solution!

From your [Koding Terminal](https://koding.com/Develop/Terminal), type the following:

```
cd ruby_koans
rake
# decide to run rake automatically from now on as you edit
gem install watchr
watchr ./koans/koans.watchr
```
